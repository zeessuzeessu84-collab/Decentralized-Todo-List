# ✅ Web3 Task Manager (On-Chain Todo)

A Decentralized Application (DApp) to manage your tasks directly on the blockchain. Every task created is a permanent record linked to your wallet address.

## 🌟 Why this project?
Unlike traditional Todo apps, this one:
- **No Database:** Uses Smart Contracts as the backend.
- **Wallet-Centric:** Each user sees only their own tasks.
- **Gas Optimized:** Efficient storage handling to save ETH.

## 🛠️ Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npx hardhat compile`
3. `npx hardhat node` (Local network start karne ke liye)
